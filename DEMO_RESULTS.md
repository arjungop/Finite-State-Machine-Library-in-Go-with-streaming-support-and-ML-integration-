### Key Innovations Demonstrated

#### 1. Declarative Self-Programming
```go
// Systems define behavior through configuration
machine, err := fsm.NewBuilder().
    AddStates("idle", "processing", "completed").
    AddEvents("start", "finish", "reset").
    AddTransitionWithCondition("idle", "start", "processing", 
        fsm.ContextHasKey("input_data")).
    AddTransitionWithAction("processing", "finish", "completed",
        fsm.LogTransition(logger.Printf)).
    SetInitialState("idle").
    Build()
```

#### 2. Autonomous Agents
The order processing system demonstrates true autonomous behavior:
- **Self-Programming**: Defines its own logic through FSM rules
- **Adaptive Behavior**: Responds to context and conditions
- **Error Recovery**: Autonomous error handling and retry logic
- **State-Driven Logic**: Behavior emerges from state transitions

#### 3. Formal Language Principles
- **Deterministic Transitions**: Based on formal automata theory
- **Guard Conditions**: Logical reasoning for decision making
- **Structured Rules**: Formal grammar governing state changes
- **Verifiable Behavior**: Predictable and auditable decisions

### Real-World Applications Ready

#### Order Processing System
```go
// Autonomous order processor with self-programming behavior
processor := NewOrderProcessor("ORD-001", 750.00)
processor.ProcessOrder() // Triggers autonomous processing

// The system self-programs its behavior through:
// - State-driven transitions
// - Context-aware conditions  
// - Adaptive error recovery
// - Autonomous progression
```

#### Vending Machine Controller
```go
// Intelligent vending machine with autonomous operation
vm := NewVendingMachine("VM-001")
vm.InsertCoin()           // Autonomous coin handling
vm.SelectProduct("A1")    // Intelligent product selection
vm.ConfirmPurchase()      // Self-managing transaction flow
```
